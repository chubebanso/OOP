Question 1: When should accessor methods be used?
       It should be used whenever we need to access or modify the private state of an object in a controlled manner.
One of the main benefits of using accessor methods is that they provide an encapsulation mechanism for the
object's internal state, preventing direct access to the object's fields from outside the object itself. This
encapsulation protects the object's internal state, making it easier to maintain over time by preventing unintended changes.

       Accessor methods are also helpful for validating and normalizing input before it gets assigned to the object's
fields. For example, a setter method for a person's age field could ensure that the age value is within a valid range,
such as between 0 and 120 years old.

       Overall, using accessor methods helps ensure that an object's internal state is accessed and modified in a
   controlled and maintainable way.

Question 2: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a
DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
       It does not allow us to do this. Java will display an error:" 'DigitalVideoDc(String)' is already defined in
'DigitalVideoDc'". It means that the method is duplicate
